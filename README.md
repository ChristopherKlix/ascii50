## How to use
ASCII50 really is mainly a reference to look up ASCII codes.

**Copy to clipboard**

You can click on any char and it will copy either the integer or char to your clipboard

**Commands**

You can run commands via the command line. You can find some available commands further down but there are also some shortcuts, easter eggs & secret commands.

The command line currently only supports the `ascii50` programm which takes one argument.

More detail: [Commands](#commands)


## Code explained
The app is currently only available on the web but I'm currently working on making it available as a macOS app as well.
Android & iOS/iPadOS might come as well (probably first as Electron-Wrapper and maybe native at some point).
As this is currently just a fun-project the progress of this undertaking depends on motivation and time :).

### Repo structure
The root directory contains **no** app-relevant code.

[hex, hexadecimal] (changes ASCII codes into hex)

[dec, decimal] (changes ASCII codes into decimal)

[source, sourcecode, github] (shows the source code)

... secret commands you said?
```
